# Restro
#### Brief description of application
Youâ€™re probably already aware that it can be hard to find the right restaurant and some times when you do and visit it, you find that it is not what you expected.You've been searching for a new restaurant to try, but it's hard to tell which ones are good. What if you could just go online and find them instantly? 

To solve this problem,  I have decided to create a restaurant finder app that helps people who are new to the area and looking for a good place to eat. Through sharing the restaurants details and also the food that they serve. You can judged how good the restaurant is from the reviews that users share.

## Project Features
* Home Page - First page user sees when they visit the site which contains all the restaurants
* Login Page - Logs in user to use the application
* Sign Up page - Registers user to use the application
* Restaurant Page - Displayes a single restaurant, its dishes and reviews.


## Objective of the project
* Logs in user to the posts page when there credentials are verified
* Signs up user to enable the use the application
* User can post questions on the posts page
* User can comment on a particular post
* User are logged out when they click the log out button
